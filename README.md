# Smart Todo List AI

A full-stack AI-powered todo list application built with Django REST Framework backend and Next.js frontend. This project helps users manage tasks, categories, and context entries, with smart AI task suggestions.

---

## About the Project

This project was developed and tested successfully on a local machine, where all frontend and backend features worked perfectly together with full API data fetching and management.

The app was deployed to Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend) for live hosting. The deployment was successful, but due to some unknown issues, certain frontend pages (especially related to categories) did not fetch data correctly on Vercel. Despite these challenges in deployment, the core functionality and architecture were fully validated and working perfectly on local devices.

The project demonstrates solid understanding of:

- Django REST Framework with PostgreSQL
- Next.js React frontend features
- Environment variable management for API URLs
- Handling CORS and deployment nuances
- API integration and CRUD operations
- AI task suggestion integration

   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Setup environment variables (`.env` file or system variables):

   ```
   DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   DJANGO_DEBUG=True
   DB_NAME=your_db_name
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost 127.0.0.1
   ```

5. Run migrations:

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create superuser for admin panel:

   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Run backend server:

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install node dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create `.env.local` file with:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. Run frontend:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment Notes

- Backend deployed on Render: https://smart-todo-list-ai.onrender.com
- Frontend deployed on Vercel: https://smart-todo-list-ai-omega.vercel.app

While deployment was successful, some frontend pages (notably categories) initially failed fetching data due to relative URL and CORS issues. These were identified and resolved by:

- Using absolute backend URLs in frontend fetch calls
- Correctly configuring CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in backend
- Ensuring `collectstatic` ran in backend deployment for serving admin CSS

The project is fully functional locally and deployable with minor tweaks.
